'''
Custom Invitations as Word Documents
Say you have a text file of guest names. This guests.txt file has one name 
per line, as follows:


Prof. Plum
Miss Scarlet
Col. Mustard
Al Sweigart
Robocop
Write a program that would generate a Word document with custom invitations 
that look like Figure 13-11.

Since Python-Docx can use only those styles that already exist in the Word 
document, you will have to first add these styles to a blank Word file and 
then open that file with Python-Docx. There should be one invitation per 
page in the resulting Word document, so call add_break() to add a page 
break after the last paragraph of each invitation. This way, you will need 
to open only one Word document to print all of the invitations at once.
