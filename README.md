# Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-with-Python
My solutions to some practice projects proposed in the book 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python'.

Each file .py contains the solution for one specific project, and the number at the beginning of the 
file refers to the chapter in the book where the project was proposed.
